The key metrics are categorized as below. For the analysis and visualization, I have used a combination of R and Excel.

## DAU/MAU Ratio
---

The DAU/MAU ratio defines the stickiness of an app. This metric tells us how many days (in percentage) in a month is the average user active in the app. For the purposes of this assignment, I have defined an active user as someone who has pinged/opened the app and has a recorded entry in the sessions data (other potential definition of active users could be an user making a purchase, having more than an x amount of pings a day, etc.). The chart is presented below:

The red line shows the regression line with the shaded region showing the confidence interval. The ratio varies between 15% to 22%. Some of the best performing gaming apps show a stickiness ratio of more than 33%. So there is cetrainly room for improvement. The regression line shows a slight rise which indicates positive growth.


## Retention
---
The chart below shows the the percentage of users coming back to use the app after 1 to 7 days and 30 days from the day they first installed the app. This chart shows us the retention rate of the apps. For sake of brevity, I have only listed the retention rates for some of the days.

The Day 1 retention rate is between 16% to 27%, for Day 7 the retention rate is between 7% to 11 % and for Day 30 it is between 3% to 7%.


## Conversion
---

The conversion rate tells us how many percentage of our daily active users are making a purchase. The chart below shows the daily convertion rate for new users and returning users.

As is normal, the conversion rates are mostly higher for returning users over new users. The conversion rate for returning users is around 0.4 to 1.5%.
