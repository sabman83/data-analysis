## Key Metrics
---

The key metrics are categorized as below. For the analysis and visualization, I have used a combination of R and Excel.


## User Engagement
---

### DAU/MAU Ratio

The DAU/MAU ratio defines the stickiness of an app. This metric tells us how many days (in percentage) in a month is the average user active in the app. For the purposes of this assignment, I have defined an active user as someone who has pinged/opened the app and has a recorded entry in the sessions data (other potential definition of active users could be an user making a purchase, having more than an x amount of pings a day, etc.). The chart is presented below:

The red line shows the regression line with the shaded region showing the confidence interval. The ratio varies between 15% to 22%. Some of the best performing gaming apps show a stickiness ratio of more than 33%. So there is cetrainly room for improvement. The regression line shows a slight rise which indicates positive growth.


### Retention

The chart below shows the the percentage of users coming back to use the app after 1 to 7 days and 30 days from the day they first installed the app. This chart shows us the retention rate of the apps. For sake of brevity, I have only listed the retention rates for some of the days. A complete chart is availble here.
