## Exploring the Data
---

I will be using R to analyze the data. The following packages are loaded:

* _lubridate_  : To parse the date time.
* _data.table_ : I prefer to use data.table over data.frame for performance efficiency.
* _ggplot2_    : To visualize data
* _dplyr_      : To perform data operations
* _rpart_      : To perform regression using decision trees
* _rpart.plot_ : To visualize the decision tree
~~~ r
> if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
Loading required package: pacman
> pacman::p_load(data.table, ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate, rpart, rpart.plot)
~~~

I import the data and set up the columns to be factor and date columns appropriately. For the *outcome* column, I set 1 as success and 0 as failure.

From the summary, we can see that we have information on the patient visits for the year 2015.
I verify that each row refers to a unique patient and also note that we have 96 physicians.

Plotting the histogram of Health Risk shows that the most of the users fall between the scores of 3 to 7 (inclusive).  The bars are broken down by the outcome of the treatment.

~~~ r
ggplot(clvr_table, aes(x=health_risk_assesment))
  + geom_bar(aes(fill = clvr_table$outcome), alpha=0.6)
  + labs(x = "Health Risk Assessment Scores", y = "Count")
  + scale_fill_manual(name="Outcome", labels = c("Failure", "Success"), values = c("red","green"))
  + ggtitle("Histogram of Health Risk Assessment Scores broken down by Outcome")
  + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
  + scale_x_discrete(limits = seq(from=1, to=10, 1))
~~~

![Histogram of Health Risk Assessment Scores](/data-analysis/assets/clvr-histogram-risk-scores.png)

Not surprisingly, the chart shows that higher the scores, higher the chances of failure. For a person with a score of 10, the chances are very slim for a successful treatment.

I now plot the Risk Scores against the Date of Treatment colored by the sex of the patient. I wanted to see if there is any pattern with respect to time periods.

~~~ r
ggplot(clvr_table, aes(x=treatment_date, y = health_risk_assesment))
  + geom_point(aes(color=member_sex))
  + labs(x = "Date of Treatment", y ="Health Risk Assessment Score")
  + ggtitle("Health Risk Assessment vs Date")
  + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
  + scale_colour_discrete(name="Sex", labels=c("Female", "Male"))

![Histogram of Health Risk Assessment Scores](/data-analysis/assets/clvd-risk-vs-date.png)

There is no discernable pattern with respect to time. But I notice that patients with high risk scores (7-10) are more likely to be males than females.

~~~ r
> success_rate_by_sex <- clvr_table %>% group_by(member_sex) %>% summarise(success_rate = sum(outcome==1)/n(), num_of_cases = n(), avg_risk_score = mean(health_risk_assesment))
> success_rate_by_sex
# A tibble: 2 × 4
  member_sex success_rate num_of_cases avg_risk_score
      <fctr>        <dbl>        <int>          <dbl>
1          0    0.4798877         2138       4.675398
2          1    0.3831200         2109       5.656235
~~~

So, females have a successful treatment rate of about 48% whereas it is only 38% for males. Their average risk score is also lesser compared to males.



## Assessment
---

### a) If you were to only consider the provider’s effectiveness with regard to this particular treatment, would you recommend reaching out to any of these doctors in particular? If so, which ones, and why?

To evaluate the doctor/physician's performance, I first collect the information about their average success rate. Since the risk score and sex are possible factors that affect the success rate, I also include the average risk assessment scores of the patients and the percentage of female
patients.

~~~ r
> doc_success_rate <- clvr_table %>% group_by(servicing_provider_id) %>% summarise(success_rate = sum(outcome==1)/n(), num_of_cases = n(), avg_risk_assessment = (mean(health_risk_assesment)), percentage_of_females_administered = round(100 * (sum(member_sex==0) / n())))  %>%  arrange(avg_risk_assessment)

Here is a plot of the information gathered above:

~~~ r
ggplot(doc_success_rate, aes(x= success_rate, y = avg_risk_assessment))
  + geom_point(aes(size=num_of_cases, color=percentage_of_females_administered))
  + labs(x = "Success Rate", y = "Average Risk Assessment Score")
  + scale_colour_continuous(name="% of Females Administered")

![Risk Scores vs Success Rate](/data-analysis/assets/clvr-score-vs-success.png)

There are some physicians who have a high success rate even if they have mostly worked with males (plotted on the extreme right with darker shades of blue). We definitely want to recommend these physicians.

The physicians in the middle of the plot show a mix of different levels of percentage of female patients and average risk scores.

Given that we have to consider these other factors when it comes to evaluating the success of the physician, I will now construct a decision tree which will hopefully split the data
based on the circumstances that make physicians successful.

~~~ r
clvr.tree.model <- rpart(clvr_table$outcome~., data = clvr_table[,c(2,6,7,8),with=FALSE])
# function to split text in multiple lines, from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22618751/rpart-plot-text-shorter
split.fun <- function(x, labs, digits, varlen, faclen) {
  # replace commas with spaces (needed for strwrap)
  labs <- gsub(",", " ", labs)
  for(i in 1:length(labs)) {
  # split labs[i] into multiple lines
  labs[i] <- paste(strwrap(labs[i], width=25), collapse="\n")
}

![Decision Tree](/data-analysis/assets/clvr-decision-tree.png)

From the tree, we can see that for patients with a risk score of higher than 2.5, their chances of a successful outcome is better with a certain group of physicians. The third terminal node from the left in the tree represent this group and the success rate is 71% for patients treated by these doctors. These physicians are listed below:

Another interesting thing to note here is that sex doesn't seem to be a major factor in deciding the outcome and for risk scores of more than 3.5 the chances of a successful outcome is only 31%.

### b) What other data would be helpful in understanding which doctors to reach out to? What other data would help you evaluate the overall clinical effectiveness of the doctor? How would you use this data?

As mentioned in the description  the health risk score is a based on a combination of different factors. Instead of building a decision tree purely the risk score, it would be more useful to build the tree by breaking down the risk score into different factors.

Some of the factors that come to my mind are:

- *Diet*: This could help find a correlation between food and the disease. This could help us provide dietary advice to the patients.
- *Geography/Location*:  This could relate to diet and also help in recommending physicians who are close to the patients.
- *Symptoms, Allergies, Health history*: This could help us with early detection of the disease
- *Sex*: We know that the member's sex is part of the risk score. But by building the tree without the risk score and using sex as a feature, we could see a split on sex in the decision tree.
- *Treatment*: What treatments were suggested? Which prove to be most successful and for what kind of patients? We can also share this information with all the physicians.


## Experiment Design
___

### A product manager wants to make a change to a piece of software that all of the physicians already possess. The change will notify the physician whenever a prescription is about to run out. How would you set up this change to know whether it had an effect? What metrics would you use to evaluate the change? What are some of the challenges of measurement with this type of change?

I would use A/B testing to test this feature in the product. Before getting into more details, I make the following assumptions:

- The physician has the current quantity of the prescriptions in a database. When the physician makes an order for prescriptions, he/she updates the database accordingly.
- The physician enters the prescription given to each of their patients in a measurable format like dosage per day. Also, if the prescriptions are fulfilled through the physician, what quantity was given out during the patient's first diagnosis.

Given this information, we can predict on which date a physician will run out of a prescription. This can be continually updated as the physicians order a new stock or hand out prescriptions to new patients or update the dosage for current patients.

We can add a pop-up/email reminder 7 days before we think the physician will run out the prescriptions. To attribute the ordering of the physician to the alert, we can add a button in the pop-up/alert to place an order. Sometimes the physician might not want to
order it right then but place an order later. We can assume that if the physician orders the prescription within 2 days of acknowledging the alert then we can attribute the order to the alert.

We can divide our set of physicians into a test and control group and use the metric of measuring the days left before the prescriptions would run out, when the next order was placed.

We can compare the average of the days between the test and the control groups to decide if the feature was effective.

Some of the challenges include:

- We have to make sure not to include physicians who are generally good at keeping up the quantity of the prescriptions. We also have to make sure the groups are selected at random. Any kind of selection bias might affect our results. For example, there are some prescriptions that are so critical that physicians always make sure that they are in stock or there maybe some which are so much in demand that it is hard to fulfill the required quantity.
- If the physician does not order through the button, then it is hard to be sure if a future order can be attributed to the alert. The 2-day gap is just an assumption.
- Do we have enough of a sample size to make sure that the difference in the metric between the groups is statistically  significant?
- How long should we run the tests for?
- The variability between quantity required for each type of prescription might make it hard to do group comparisons.
