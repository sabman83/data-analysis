## Top Entertainment platforms

Some of the top entertainment platforms that I have personally used: 
* Steam, 
* Netflix, 
* Amazon, 
* Alamo Drafthouse
* Spotify
* Songza (now part of Google Play)
### a. What makes them successful?

*Consitent:*
One of the things that standout for me in all of the above mentioned platforms is the consitency. With Steam, it doesn't matter which platform I am using. I started using it in a Windows machine and installed it on a linux desktop and a Mac laptop. All my purchases are intact and I can easily install (almost) and play all my games.
With Netflix, Amazon and Spotify , I can switch between different devices and still be able to watch movies, listen to music, read my books. They all remember where I last left off and provides easy access to my content. 
The Alamo Drafthouse is a theater chain. I first experienced it when it opened in San Francisco. Getting to watch eclectic movies with food served right where you are seated is a fun experience. When I visited their Austin theater, I expected the same service and selection of quality movies and I was not disappointed. 

Providing the user with a familiar experience is important. There are no surprise elements and the user knows exactly how to go about achieving the action they want to perform with the product.

*Reliable:*
Their services are almost always available. I don't remember the last time their services were down. Even if the services are down for some percent of the time, it can be very frustrating for the user. I know of instances where Githib has been down and it caused a lot of frustration for the developers. Even though the downtime must be around 95-99%, it is the 1%-5% that users remember and complain about.

*Customer Support*
The customer support for Amazon and Netflix are excellent. They trust their customers and ensure that resolving the problem is as easy as possible. I can leave my phone number with Amazon and they will call me back when I am next in line. I can return products without providing any proof for my reason to return the product. They are constantly rated the highest in customer satisfaction. 
I have been an Airbnb customer for many years and recently I had to cancel a stay because I had trouble sleeping through the night. There was a rail track right next to the apartment and there was a train every hour. This was not listed in the description when I first made the purchase. I contacted Airbnb and requested a refund. But I was informed that since I stayed the night, I shall not be refunded for the night. I can understand why they have this polciy as it can be misused by users. But given that I have been a long time customer , there is very little chance for me to be lying about this. Ideally, they should have accepted my reasoning and provided the refund. Now, because of their poor service, tomorrow if there is another alternative to Airbnb, I would switch in a second. Whereas with Amazon and Netflix, I would be loyal and expect the competitor to be top knotch for me to coinsider swtiching.
