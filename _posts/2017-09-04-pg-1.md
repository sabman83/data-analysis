## Top Entertainment platforms

Some of the top entertainment platforms that I have personally used: 
* Steam, 
* Netflix, 
* Amazon, 
* Alamo Drafthouse
* Spotify
* Songza (now part of Google Play)
### a. What makes them successful?

*Consitent:*
One of the things that standout for me in all of the above mentioned platforms is the consitency. With Steam, it doesn't matter which platform I am using. I started using it in a Windows machine and installed it on a linux desktop and a Mac laptop. All my purchases are intact and I can easily install (almost) and play all my games.
With Netflix, Amazon and Spotify , I can switch between different devices and still be able to watch movies, listen to music, read my books. They all remember where I last left off and provides easy access to my content. 
The Alamo Drafthouse is a theater chain. I first experienced it when it opened in San Francisco. Getting to watch eclectic movies with food served right where you are seated is a fun experience. When I visited their Austin theater, I expected the same service and selection of quality movies and I was not disappointed. 

Providing the user with a familiar experience is important. There are no surprise elements and the user knows exactly how to go about achieving the action they want to perform with the product.

*Reliable:*
Their services are almost always available. I don't remember the last time their services were down. Even if the services are down for some percent of the time, it can be very frustrating for the user. I know of instances where Githib has been down and it caused a lot of frustration for the developers. Even though the downtime must be around 95-99%, it is the 1%-5% that users remember and complain about.

*Customer Support*
The customer support for Amazon and Netflix are excellent. They trust their customers and ensure that resolving the problem is as easy as possible. I can leave my phone number with Amazon and they will call me back when I am next in line. I can return products without providing any proof for my reason to return the product. They are constantly rated the highest in customer satisfaction. 
I have been an Airbnb customer for many years and recently I had to cancel a stay because I had trouble sleeping through the night. There was a rail track right next to the apartment and there was a train every hour. This was not listed in the description when I first made the purchase. I contacted Airbnb and requested a refund. But I was informed that since I stayed the night, I shall not be refunded for the night. I can understand why they have this polciy as it can be misused by users. But given that I have been a long time customer , there is very little chance for me to be lying about this. Ideally, they should have accepted my reasoning and provided the refund. Now, because of their poor service, tomorrow if there is another alternative to Airbnb, I would switch in a second. Whereas with Amazon and Netflix, I would be loyal and expect the competitor to be top knotch for me to coinsider swtiching.

*Quality and Quantity of Content*
All these platforms, have build a fine collection of content that includes both original and licensed. And they provide tools to easily wade through the content through recommendations, categorization and community reviews. Alamo Drafthouse are associated with supporting and promoting genre films. They have a "Alamo Recommends" section which lists the must watch films. They run a weekly series of programs focusing on different genres and obscure films. 

*Innovative*
Netflix and Amazon invest a lot on technology and they are constantly making changes and changing before others do. Netflix's transition from discs to streaming, producing original content, Amazon's using robots in their warehouses, using drones for delivery, are all examples of innovating which not only improve the quality of service but also help keep their costs low. Spotify have been innovative by moving beyond songs adding features like Radio, Concerts and Podcasts. Alamo Drafthouse hosts the Fantastic Film Festival every year and over the years they have improved the way for users to book tickets and providing a fair ticketing system. They even have a process in place for ticket holders to get to their theaters without any hassles (since multiple movies are playing in different theaters at the same time). All this has been possible because they have embraced technology beyond other theaters and film festivals. 

*Community*
Through social media or through thier own websites, they have provided a platform for users to communicate with each other and provide a sense of community.



b. How do people get hooked?
To get people hooked you need to provide a great first time experience. The user interface should be simple and there should be as few paths as possible to get to the content the user wants. Amazon have so many different types of products besides books. But because they have well defined and granular categories, it is easy for the user to find what s/he wants. Same with Netflix and their genre/theme classifications. 

The search options in these services are exhaustive and easily sortable. The sections and features are clearly laid out. If the collection seem overwhelming then the user might soon lose interest. 

When you first get to you seat in the Alamo Drafthouse, a server tells you how to order food and when the bill is brought out so that there is no confusion during the screening of the movie. Before the movie starts, there is a very clear (and  usually funny) video message to shut off cell phones. All through the process they make you feel they you are being cared for and they your experience is of utmost importance.


c. What makes them come back?
The recommendation system and the quality of the reommendations are what makes the people come back. More often than not, the user is unsure of what they are looking for or what they are in the mood for. A good recommendation system can understand the needs of the user and immediately provide access to a stream of content. If the recommendation is not satisfactory, the user would be less inclined to come back again. 

I have listed Songza(now defunct) which is one of the best apps I have ever used. When I open the app it provides a list of moods / situation I might be interested in and on making a selection it shows me few playlists. The options are never daunting. They are usually around 3-4 and something that easily fits in the screen. The quality of playlists was outstanding. They were not crowd sourced but created by "music experts". Besides the simplicty of the process, what always stood out for me was the moods suggestions was almost always spot on. I once opened the app during late evening while I was cooking and one of the moods was "Cookout". When I openend the app before driving, one of the suggestions was "Long Drive". 

And I believe this holds true for any successful entertainment platform. An effective recommendation system with a simple user experience backed by great content is what keeps people hooked.
This question seems related to the previous one. 

d. Select one of the platforms you mentioned above and discuss how
long does it take to create great content for this platform?

1998 - 2007
Inital years, few DVDs

More users, more discs.

queuing system to make up for lack of inventory
2007-2013
streaming services

expanded, more licesning

2013
Original content


e. How is the content of the platform you chose organized, and why is
that effective?
Netflix lays out the content in a grid like format with each row representing a category. I can swipe across a row from left to right to browse content within the same category and swipe up and down to browse across categories. I find this effective because this behavior is same on phone , tablet or my tv. 

When a movie is highlighted while browsing the top part of the display shows the movie title, length and a short blurb. This makes it easy to quickly and clearly see what the movie is abbout. It also shows different screenshots from the movie, which can make the movie intriguing for me to watch. They run A/B tests to decide which image is most effective (effective meaning the user continued to watch the film after having seen the image) for a movie.

What I don't effective is the inconsistent listing of the categories. Sometimes the "Continue Watching" is at the top and sometime "Trending" and sometimes I even have to make many scrolls to get to the "Continue Watching" section. Again, this could be part of another A/B test so hopefully they get to the right layout for me soon.

Getting to content outside of those listed in this front layout is easy enough. I hit the menu button and get to the search option. Each letter I type, provides an auto-complete list of terms I might be looking for. I can also search by Cast/Crew. Another neat feature is if I don't find a film I am looking for it lists the titles that are similar to the film.
