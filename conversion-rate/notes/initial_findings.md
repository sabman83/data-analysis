*On Summarizing*

- Only 4 countries (China, Germnay, UK and US)
- Mean age of 30.57, range from 17 - 123, 123 seems strange, maybe an error?
- Mean session of 4.8 pages
- Percentage of new users  = 68.55
- Percentage of converted users = 3.225
- No NA or omitted data

- plotting age vs converted doesn't seem to imply anything
-  there seems to be 2 outliers
- no one from china converted
- All those who visit more than 20 definitely convert
- Ages 61 and over don't convert
- Sources doesn't seem to play a pivotal role
- Amongst the converted users most are not new users
- Fewer converted users are from China

- Current conversion  = conversion / total sessions = 0.66198 %


?-  So we need to predict conversion rate. Isn't it enough to predict a conversion?
